🎯 Footfall Counter using Computer Vision

A real-time AI-powered system that accurately detects, tracks, and counts people entering and exiting through doorways, corridors, or any designated area.
Built with YOLOv8 and OpenCV, this project demonstrates how artificial intelligence and computer vision can be applied to solve real-world problems like crowd monitoring and occupancy management.

🌟 Overview

This project implements an intelligent footfall counting system that:

✅ Detects people in video frames using YOLOv8
✅ Tracks individuals across frames with unique IDs
✅ Counts entries and exits based on virtual line crossing
✅ Visualizes real-time statistics with bounding boxes and trajectories
✅ Handles multiple people, occlusions, and varying lighting conditions

🧩 Real-World Applications

Retail stores — customer traffic analysis

Office buildings — occupancy monitoring

Public spaces — crowd management

Events — attendance tracking

Smart buildings — energy optimization

✨ Features
🔹 Core Functionality

Real-time Person Detection: Uses YOLOv8n (nano) for fast, efficient person detection.

Persistent Tracking: Each person is assigned a unique ID that remains consistent across frames.

Bidirectional Counting: Detects both entries and exits through a defined line.

Visual Counting Line: A customizable on-screen line that triggers counting events.

Live Statistics Display: Real-time overlay showing entries, exits, and current occupancy.

🔹 Visual Highlights

🟦 Blue Bounding Boxes: Currently tracked individuals.

🟢 Green Bounding Boxes: People who have crossed the line (counted).

🟡 Yellow Line: Virtual counting line.

📊 Statistics Panel: Live count overlay.

🔵 Trajectories: Visual movement paths for each person.

🔹 Technical Advantages

Modular, clean, and readable codebase.

Adjustable parameters for confidence, line position, and memory length.

Works with both video files and live webcam streams.

Optional video recording of output.

Frame-by-frame progress tracking and pause/resume functionality.

📐 Counting Logic

The system uses a centroid-based line crossing algorithm:

Compute the center point of each detected person.

Track each person’s movement across frames.

Compare the previous and current Y-positions relative to the counting line.

Logic Example:

If prev_y < line_y and curr_y >= line_y → Entry

If prev_y > line_y and curr_y <= line_y → Exit

Once a crossing is detected, the person’s ID is marked as “counted” to avoid double counting.

Example:

Frame 1: y = 200, Line = 300 → Above line
Frame 2: y = 320, Line = 300 → Below line
Result: Entry detected ✅

📦 Installation
🧰 Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

Webcam (optional, for real-time testing)

At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)

🪜 Step 1: Get the Project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd footfall-counter


or download and extract the ZIP.

🪜 Step 2: Install Dependencies
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python ultralytics numpy


or use the requirements file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🪜 Step 3: Prepare Your Video

Place your test video (e.g., test.mp4) in the project directory.

Alternatively, use a webcam by setting VIDEO_PATH = 0 in the code.

🚀 Usage
▶️ Quick Start
python footfall_counter.py

🧪 Using a Video File
VIDEO_PATH = "video.mp4"


then:

python footfall_counter.py

🎥 Using a Webcam
VIDEO_PATH = 0


then:

python footfall_counter.py

⌨️ Controls During Execution
Key	Action
ESC	Stop and exit the program
SPACE	Pause/Resume video playback
🧾 Example Console Output
Video loaded: 1920x1080 @ 30 FPS
Processing... Press 'ESC' to quit, 'SPACE' to pause

Frame 30: Entries=2, Exits=0, Current=2
Frame 60: Entries=5, Exits=1, Current=4
...
Final Results:
Total Entries: 45
Total Exits: 38
Current Occupancy: 7

⚙️ Configuration

At the top of the script:

# Video Source
VIDEO_PATH = "test.mp4"          # Or 0 for webcam

# Detection Settings
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.4       # 0.0–1.0 (adjust for accuracy)

# Counting Line Settings
LINE_POSITION = 0.5              # 0.0 = top, 1.0 = bottom

# Tracking Settings
TRACK_HISTORY_LENGTH = 30        # Smoothness vs memory


Recommended Settings

Scenario	Confidence	Line Position	Notes
Crowded mall	0.5	0.5	Higher confidence to reduce false positives
Office corridor	0.3	0.5	Lower confidence to detect everyone
Outdoor entrance	0.4	0.4	Adjust based on camera angle
Overhead camera	0.4	0.5	Standard settings work well

🧩 Troubleshooting
Issue	Possible Solutions
“Error: Could not open video file”	Ensure file exists, correct path, use .mp4, or try full path.
“No module named 'ultralytics'”	Run pip install ultralytics.
Webcam not working	Close other apps (Zoom, Teams), try different index (1, 2), or check permissions.
Poor detection	Adjust confidence, improve lighting, or try larger YOLO model.
Counting inaccuracies	Adjust line position, increase tracking history, or ensure proper camera angle.
Slow performance	Use YOLOv8n (nano), lower video resolution, or run on GPU.
